In this project, we applied Python and object-oriented programming skills to build a program that plays the game of Rock Paper Scissors. I built classes that represent the game and its players. The computer players follows various different strategies, as well as a human player class that lets a human play the game against the computer.

The game has two players. In a single round of the game, each player secretly chooses one of three moves, or "throws" â€” rock, paper, or scissors. Then, players reveal their moves at the same time. If both players picked the same move, there is no winner. Otherwise, rock beats scissors; paper beats rock; and scissors beat paper. Players can play a single round, or "best of three", or any number of other options.
Try importing it into the Python interpreter and experimenting with the Player and Game objects.
